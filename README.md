I am driven, reliable, honest, detail oriented, love learning, and enjoy thinking through issues to develop solutions. I type and have excellent computer skills. 
I like helping people, have a calm pleasant demeanor, have great interpersonal skills, and present myself in a professional and courteous manner. 

I am currently in my last semester of a two-year IT Programming program at Nova Scotia Community College, Centre of Geographic Science. 
I also exceled at the first year of a Business Administration program before I decided to switch to IT for the challenge.

I am currently the Project Manager of my Capstone project. I am gaining experience in preparing reports, manuals, and other documentation. 
I am also gaining experience with collecting and documenting user requirements and developing logical and physical specifications with my team. 
In my classes are writing, modifying, and integrating software code.

My experience working in the office of the Annapolis Valley Exhibition prepared me to multi-task and focus in a very busy environment. 
I developed superior time management skills, and I was required to prioritize work to meet strict deadlines. 
This was a very intense fast paced environment where the whole team was required to work collaboratively to achieve our goals. 
Each of us had various areas that we took a leadership role in. I was required to solve customers issues as quickly as possible while staying 
calm no matter how complex or difficult the situation. During my time with them I created online forms and an Access database as well as using 
Excel, Word, Adobe, Google Suite, and various other programs to achieve my objectives. I worked individually and collaboratively with 
fellow employees, various committees, and a Board of Directors. I took over the role of General Manager when it became necessary. 

This and various other experiences have prepared me to stay calm under pressure and communicate in a professional manner both in writing and verbally. 
I made various connections within the community and fostered a good relationship with volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, and attendees. 
My time at the Nova Scotia Community College has honed my skills and ensured I will be an asset to any organization. 
I have been introduced to HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel Framework, C++, C#, Java, SQL, and Python. I have used mySQL, SQlite, Postgres, and Access database software as well as QGIS. 
I have a basic understanding of Linux and XML. I love to learn and look forward to staying up to date on new technologies.
I can communicate technical knowledge effectively to those less technical and practice this skill regularly with family, friends, and during my work terms.
